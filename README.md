Midi Sandbox is a free collection of midi responsive widgets made for musicians, teachers, and students. Fill in the gaps of your music theory knowledge, enhance your creative process, communicate musical ideas efficiently, and create your own templates/tutorials.

The original idea for this project was to experiment with the many ways that midi can be used in combination with other web technologies to enhance music education. Since there are seemingly an infinite amount of ways to use midi in the browser, Midi Sandbox was intentionally structured to scale to support as many widgets as can be thought of. Equally as important, users can completely customize their own templates by choosing which widgets they want to use and how to arrange them. Consequently, there is no right or wrong way to use Midi Sandbox, but if you want to get some ideas you can check out the tutorials on our [home page](https://midisandbox.com) or [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_BY6HSKHZgZDdBUypbiXmw/videos).

# How to contribute

This public repo contains the core of Midi Sandbox with some missing features that you might find on midisandbox.com, such as the media player for the Sheet Music widget. However, this code still functions as a standalone web app and all updates to it will be merged into the full-featured web app that you see on our website.

If you just want to help out in general you can give us a ‚≠ê on Github.
